# **`pcg_skel`** Documentation

`pcg_skel` is a package used to rapidly build neuronal skeletons from electron microscopy data in the CAVE ecosystem.
It integrates structural data, connectivity data, and local features stored across many aspects of a CAVE system, and creates objects as MeshParty meshes, skeletons, and MeshWork files for subsequent analysis.
By harnessing the way the structural data is stored, you can build skeletons for even very large neurons efficiently.

## Installation

To install `pcg_skel`, just use pip. The package is available for python versions 3.7 and above.
